        <div class="notbuy" style="align-items: right;">
            <h2 style="color: #E0E0E0;">❌You should not buy it if:</h2>

            <div style="padding: 15px;">

            <p><b>˃You’re on a tight budget</b> – The iQOO 13 Legend is a premium flagship, and its price reflects that. If affordability is your priority, there are better mid-range options.</p>

            <p><b>˃You prefer stock Android</b> – iQOO’s custom UI may include extra features and pre-installed apps that might not appeal to users who prefer a clean, bloat-free experience.</p>

            <p><b>˃You don’t need extreme performance</b> – If your usage is limited to casual browsing, messaging, and social media, this phone’s powerful specs might be overkill.</p>

            <p><b>˃You dislike large phones</b> – With its massive display and battery, the iQOO 13 Legend is big and may not be comfortable for users who prefer compact, one-handed devices.</p>

            <p><b>˃You want wireless charging</b> – Despite its premium build, it lacks wireless charging—a dealbreaker for some in this price range.</p>

            <p><b>˃You’re a camera purist</b> – While the cameras are excellent, users who prioritize professional-level photography might still prefer flagship camera phones like Pixel or iPhone Pro models.</p>

            <p><b>˃You need extended software support</b> – iQOO’s software update policy might not match brands like Samsung or Apple, who offer 4–5 years of updates.</p>

            <p><b>˃You prefer a minimal look</b> – The bold design, especially the Legend edition styling, might not appeal to users who want a subtle or classic aesthetic.</p>

            <p><b>˃You rely on headphone jacks</b> – There’s no 3.5mm jack, so wired audio users will need adapters or wireless alternatives.</p>

            <p><b>˃You’re not a fan of Vivo’s ecosystem</b> – If you’re already invested in another brand (Apple, Samsung, etc.), switching ecosystems might be inconvenient.</p>
